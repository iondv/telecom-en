## Description  

**IONDV. Telecom** - is a web application based on [IONDV. Framework](https://iondv.com). It is used as a registry to account, store, and present the data on the 
availability of communication services (Internet, mobile communications, television, mail, etc.) in populated areas of the region. 
It also includes information on communications availability in the "Healthcare" and "Education" sectors. The key entity is a "Locality" that contains links to each industry listed in the system. 
The app is free for everyone but available only in Russian.

The main advantage of using the system is an analysis of the current state of the telecommunication sector in the region to take timely measures to improve the quality of communications.
In addition, the application provides maintenance and data on the types of communication at the same time in different industries and regions, and also allows you to display the necessary data in the open form that does not require authorization.
